DOCUMENTATION:

1-. THE PROBLEM
We have the task of do a trivial game, based on questions. To do that, we are going to create an application to do read the questions from a file and, process them and save them in a database.
Processing the questions should warranting that there is no errors. 

2-. METHODOLOGY
We are going to use ADD method and SEI norm

The SEI Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) method is a systematic step-by-step method for designing the software architecture
of a software-intensive system. It is an approach to defining software architectures by basing the design process on the architecture's
quality attribute requirements.

It follows a recursive decomposition process where, at each stage in the decomposition, tactics and architectural patterns
are chosen to satisfy a set of quality attribute scenarios.

3-. PEOPLE INVOLVED ON THE APPLICATION
- Developers:   their purpose is to make the application previously described, as maintainable as possible
-Teachers (clients): They are going to use (evaluate) the application.


4.- STAKEHOLDERS
  A stakeholder is a person, group of persons, or organization that has a vested interest in the
application and that share a common set of concerns and interests in the application. So, the stakeholders 
of our applications are:
    - Developers: the group of developers
    - Client: the teachers
    
    Every stakeholder or group of stakeholders has a different viewpoint of the project and the
architect has to model this viewpoint
