Requirements
You need a computer with the JVM installed in order to run our Scala program.
You need MongoDB to store the questions already parsed.

Behaviour
The program starts and asks for the path to the filename where the questions are.
When the path is located, the program detects the format of the file.
Then it is parsed into JSON and stored in MongoDB.
