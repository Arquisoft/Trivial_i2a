1.- STAKEHOLDERS
  A stakeholder is a person, group of persons, or organization that has a vested interest in the
application and that share a common set of concerns and interests in the application. So, the stakeholders 
of our applications are:
    - Developers: (write here the names)
    - Client: (teachers)
    
    Every stakeholder or group of stakeholders has a different viewpoint of the project and the
architect has to model this viewpoint
