The problem
Once we delevelop the system that can obtain the questions  and the prototype of the Trivial game, 
the NoGame company decided to develop the same game, but with some modifications. The marketing 
department og the NoGame has observed that the Trivial game can have a greater impact if it came 
be used through the Web, where users can connect and play between them.

The previous logc of the game could be reused, but we added a new layer that allows players to connect to the web,
create a new game and play with it.
