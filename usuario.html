<p>This is the user manual of the Trivial game of the group i2a. The objective of the game is getting the four
'quesitos' before your opponents. To do so, you have to throw the dice and try to get to the boxes that have
one by answering questions. If you fail one, you will give the turn to your next opponent. Try to answer right
to all the questions you are asked and go for the win!</p>

<h4>Choosing a user</h4>
<p>The first thing you will have to do before playing will be choosing a user. If you don't have any, write your
name in the field and click on the Accept button. A list with all the users will appear, where you can select
your user. Now you can go to the next step. </p>

<h4>Choosing a game</h4>
<p>Once you've selected a player, you have to choose among the available games and pick the one you want to
join to. If there's not available games, you can create a new one in the same way a player is created. Just 
enter the name of the game, that will be added to the list of games when you click on accept . </p>

<h4>Play</h4>
<p>After selecting a game, you will be shown a window with its current state. In that page appears the name of
the game, the current player and the value of the dice. In addition, you can see the board state, showing to which 
cells the player can move.</p>

<h2>IMAGEn3</h2>

<p>The way to play is very simple: the dice is thrown automatically, so you don't have to care about that. Once the
value of the dice is obtained, the cells that allow a possible movement have a thick border painted in a golden 
color. Clicking in one of them will move you to this cell, and a question will be asked to you. D epending on the
color of the cell the category will be History, Entertainment, Science or Geography. You will have to answer the
question correctly to keep playing. If you fail, you will give the turn to the ne xt player. But, watch out! If you
are in a cell that has a gradient color, it means you are in a 'quesito' cell! Answering correctly to the proposed
question will give you a wedge. Once you get four, you win the game!</p>

<p>There's another special cell, which is the one in the center. This box will randomly ask you a question of any
category, but if you choose the right answer, you will get a wedge of this category!  </p>

<p>In addition to that, grey boxes are ThrowAgainBoxes, meaning that you wonâ€™t be asked any question, but continue
playing from there. They are a great advantage, so make sure to fall on them.</p>

<p>Once you get all the wedges, you win the game. Try not to fail so many questions, or your opponents will defeat
you. If you do it well, this is the screen you are supposed to see: </p>

<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
