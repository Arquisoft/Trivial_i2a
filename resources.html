<h2>ECLIPSE</h2>
<p>
  In computer programming, Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace 
  and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used 
  to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other
  programming languages: Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Lua, Natural, Perl, PHP, 
  Prolog, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. It can
  also be used to develop packages for the software Mathematica. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT 
  for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.
</p>
<p>
The initial codebase originated from IBM VisualAge.The Eclipse software development kit (SDK), which includes the Java 
development tools, is meant for Java developers. Users can extend its abilities by installing plug-ins written for 
the Eclipse Platform, such as development toolkits for other programming languages, and can write and contribute their 
own plug-in modules.
</p>
<p>
Released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License, Eclipse SDK is free and open source software 
(although it is incompatible with the GNU General Public License). It was one of the first IDEs to 
run under GNU Classpath and it runs without problems under IcedTea.

<h2>MongoDB</h2>
<p>
  MongoDB is one of many cross-platform document-oriented databases. Classified as a NoSQL database,
  MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with 
  dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications
  easier and faster. Released under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License, 
  MongoDB is free and open-source software.
</p>
<p>
First developed by the software company 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.) in October 2007 as a component of a planned platform 
as a service product, the company shifted to an open source development model in 2009, with 10gen offering commercial
support and other services.Since then, MongoDB has been adopted as backend software by a number of major websites
and services, including Craigslist, eBay, Foursquare, SourceForge, Viacom, and the New York Times, among others. 
MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL database system

<h2>Apache Maven</h2>
<p>
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project 
object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece 
of informat

<h2>Travis CI</h2>
<p>
  In software development, Travis CI is an open-source hosted, distributed continuous integration service used 
  to build and test projects hosted at GitHub.
</p>
<p>
Travis CI is configured by adding a file named .travis.yml, which is a YAML format text file, to the root directory 
of the GitHub repository.

<h2>Cucumber</h2>
<p>
  Cucumber is a software tool that computer programmers use for testing other software. It runs automated acceptance tests 
  written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. Cucumber is written in the Ruby programming language.
  Cucumber projects are available for other platforms beyond Ruby. Some use Ruby Cucumber with a bridge into the 
  target language (e.g. cuke4php and cuke4lua). Others use the Gherkin parser but implement everything else in the
  target language.Cucumber allows the execution of feature documentation written in business-facing text.
