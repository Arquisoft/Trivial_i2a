The problem
Once we delevelop the system that can obtain the questions  and the prototype of the Trivial game, 
the NoGame company decided to develop the same game, but with some modifications. The marketing 
department og the NoGame has observed that the Trivial game can have a greater impact if it came 
be used through the Web, where users can connect and play between them.

The previous logc of the game could be reused, but we added a new layer that allows players to connect to the web,
create a new game and play with it. 

The company also want that the players will be registered in the web in a very simple way, that allows them to
know the historical data. Furthermore, when a user is connected, should be able to know if other users 
are connected to invite them to participate in a game. 

One the users accept to play a game, it should be in a very similar way that the desktop one. However, it is a web game,
so it is possible that a player loses its connection to the web, and leaves it without any notification. 
The system should deal with these problems.

Given that the company expects to have a big number of users, the architecture 
must be scalable and offer good answer times to the actions of the connected users.

The company wants that the solution has a separation between the game logic and the user interface so they can
experiment with different visualization types. The company is also interested in a web based solution that works 
in different devices so they expect a solution that follows the responsive design principles and web standards.

It is a prototype, and it is expected a web application that can manages games and players. The game logic, as I said,
should be separately of the rest of the application. In the prototype, it is possible to restrict the system so in each 
game there can only be one player



Methodology
The study of the architecture will follow the Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) (Bass, et al., 2003) and the 
standard of the SEI (ANSI/IEEE 1471, 2000). 



Stakeholders	
The first step is to contextualize the problem and identify the stakeholders. 
This project will be named “Trivial Game” (TG), so that the context of references and stakeholders can be determined.
The client is a company named NoGame.


In this case, the stakeholders are:
•	People in charge of NoGame.
•	Development team of the TG.
•	Players of the TG.
•	Privileged users that can access the game stats.


People in charge of NoGame
These are the directors of the corporation, in charge of the budget, from which they allocate funds for the project.
They have to ensure that the project remains with a low cost and that can be ended before the given deadline.
